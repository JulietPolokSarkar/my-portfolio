            <h2>Programmer and Developer</h2>
            <p>I'd like to introduce myself as someone who is interested in gaining practical knowledge. I aspire to
                work on applications that are used by billions of people and have a global inﬂuence. I'm proﬁcient in
                PHP, HTML,CSS, JavaScript, Java, jQuery, Python, R, C, C++, and the FLASK framework, and I'm constantly
                learning other programming languages. My research focuses on the broad areas of machine learning, image
                processing, neural network, deep learning, and biomedical engineering. I'm particularly interested in
                building robust and interpretable Machine Learning approaches for real-world problems, including those
                encountered in healthcare and agriculture. When I have some spare time, I enjoy painting and reading
                comic books. Aside from these interests, I like photography and traveling.</p>

            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Today’s web page developer landscape is full of innovative projects and intelligent people. Together,
                these factors push the industry forward at amazing speeds, while also making it more difficult for
                individual web developers to be outstanding. I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any
                simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites
                and learn advanced topics.

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
