            <h3>Programmer and Developer</h3>
            <p>I'd like to introduce myself as someone who is interested in gaining practical knowledge. I aspire to
                work on applications that are used by billions of people and have a global inﬂuence. I'm proﬁcient in
                PHP, HTML,CSS, JavaScript, Java, jQuery, Python, R, C, C++, and the FLASK framework, and I'm constantly
                learning other programming languages. My research focuses on the broad areas of machine learning, image
                processing, neural network, deep learning, and biomedical engineering. I'm particularly interested in
                building robust and interpretable Machine Learning approaches for real-world problems, including those
                encountered in healthcare and agriculture. When I have some spare time, I enjoy painting and reading
                comic books. Aside from these interests, I like photography and traveling.</p>
